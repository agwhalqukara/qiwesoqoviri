He doesn’t approve of his sister’s relationship and engagement to TV personality Ryan, despite the fact that he truly has no say in the issue. Before Patrick can react, disaster strikes and Ryan is involved in a deadly <a href=#>accident</a>. Patrick tries to dispose of the body, much to the amusement of the audience, in order to spare his sister any heartache and to clear his name of any wrongdoing.</p><p>This could be the throwback you missed if you like the silly sound design that frequently accompanied comedy films in the <a href=#>1990s</a> and 2000s since it wasn’t widely distributed in theaters.</p><h3><span id=A_Simple_Favor>A Simple Favor</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/a-simple-favor.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>A Simple Favor can be useful if you enjoy a little mystery mixed in with your chuckles. This film is brought to life by excellent performances from Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick.</p><p>Anna Kendrick’s character Stephanie Smothers is a single mother who makes friends with Emily, a high society mother whose son attends the same school as her son. Soon later, Emily vanishes, and Stephanie makes the decision to look for leads. The plot has some thriller aspects, but it is not nearly as grim as some of the others on this list. Is the suspense comparable to a show like <a href=#>Knives Out</a>? No, but it is enjoyable anyway.</p><h3><span id=Bon_Cop_Bad_Cop>Bon Cop, Bad Cop</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bon-cop-bad-cop.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite being nominated and won in multiple categories at the 27th Genie Awards, Bon Cop, Bad Cop was never widely distributed to theaters outside of Canada.</p><p>A joint investigation is started when a body is discovered on the border between English-speaking Ontario and French-speaking Quebec. As a member of the Quebec police force, David Bouchard is a rule-breaking detective who frequently breaks the law. He is accompanied by stiff Ontario police detective Martin Ward. This film may adhere closely to the stereotype of the “straight man, funny man,” but what sets it apart is its capacity to subtly mock both sides of Canada in a bilingual setting.</p><h3><span id=Canadian_Bacon>Canadian Bacon</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/canadian-bacon.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The book Canadian Bacon paints a picture of what a conflict between the United States and Canada would be like. Anti-Canada propaganda appears seemingly out of nowhere as the US economy falters and the president’s approval ratings decline, and new jobs are created at armory companies.</p><p>Canadian Bacon, in contrast to the most of the other films on this list, has a reputation for being so awful that it is fantastic. Despite being a comedy, it is funny for reasons other than the ones that were anticipated. In the words of the character Boomer, “don’t think about it too much.” “There are appropriate times to act and to contemplate. And now is not the time to think, gentlemen.”</p><h3><span id=Corner_Gas_The_Movie>Corner Gas: The Movie</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/corner-gas-the-movie.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Given that we just talked about how Corner Gas is a TV show and not a movie, you might be shocked to see it on our list. Nevertheless, it was well-liked enough to merit a stand-alone movie.</p><p>The movie follows the lives of the citizens of the little town of Dog River five years after the events of the series finale, when the mayor recklessly bankrupts the <a href=#>community</a>. The locals try to rescue their house through a series of amusing incidents by competing to be named the “Quaintest Town in Canada” in a national competition. Fans of the original series will undoubtedly appreciate the film because, as many people have commented, it feels a lot like the program. However, if you haven’t seen every episode, you might not get all the humor.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u00346d085db64d4d3f3556f9fb237a03><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>5 Comedy Movies Like Vacation Friends You Can Watch For A Fun Time</span></a><h3><span id=Dr_Cabbie>Dr. Cabbie</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/dr-cabbie.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Dr. Cabbie, the first <a href=#>romantic comedy</a> on this list, is a ridiculous film about an Indian doctor who immigrated to Canada but is unable to practice medicine. After delivering a baby in his cab, he decides not to go home and instead works as a cab driver, sharing his patients’ medical information without their consent. In every rom-com, there is some sort of star-crossed romance, but this one is particularly absurd because the mother of the child he delivers ends up falling madly in love with the lead character.</p><p>While there are some cheap chuckles and cliched <a href=#>jokes</a> in this film, as long as you don’t take it too seriously, you’ll have a blast laughing at this original perspective on life.</p><h3><span id=FUBAR>FUBAR</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Fubar1.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The movie 21 FUBAR FUBAR is about friendship, but not in the way that Disney would have you believe.</p><p>As we follow the antics of the main protagonists Terry and Dean, it begins out tremendously silly, nearly to the point of being painful. But as the story develops, one of the two men receives a dire health diagnosis, shocking the other to the core. Even while this seems gloomy, the story is masterfully told in a way that keeps everything feeling somewhat lighter. Shotgun a <a href=#>beer</a> with the guys and laugh heartily while you continue to observe.</p><h3><span id=Goon>Goon</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/goon.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Ice hockey and being exceedingly courteous are two characteristics that most people associate with Canadians. When you consider the brutal fights that occur during some ice hockey games, those two things don’t really fit together, which is why why Goon is so funny.</p><p>The main character Doug Smith’s memoirs was really adapted for the screen. Despite being dramatized, several amusing events, like the time Doug scored a goal with his behind, actually happened. The main attraction is a cast of likable, complex, and heartfelt people. Goon might just tickle your funny bone if you enjoy sports and a good laugh.</p><h3><span id=Outrageous>Outrageous!</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/outrageous.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Outrageous! is a somewhat dramatic comedy film about a female impersonator and his <a href=#>schizophrenia</a> roommate. It is based on the short story Making It from Margaret Gibson’s collection The Butterfly Ward. Despite featuring LGBT themes, the 1977 film was extensively seen in theaters and won a number of prizes. Perhaps it was Craig Russell’s skill in making his character Robin Turner seem and sound like so many famous female figures of the era.</p><p>The majority of the film is animated and peppy, and it provides a fascinating look at drag culture in the 1970s. This film is unquestionably worthwhile to watch if you have any interest in anything LGBTQ+.</p><h3><span id=Seducing_Dr_Lewis>Seducing Dr. Lewis</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/seducing-dr-lewis.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The English title Dr. Lewis may not be as elegant-sounding as the original French term La grande seduction, but it conveys the same meaning. The story takes place in the fishing community of Ste-Marie-la-Mauderne, off the coast of Quebec, where the locals are forced to rely nearly exclusively on welfare and some even choose to leave their community in search of employment. However, a plastic container manufacturer verbally agrees to rejuvenate the neighborhood by opening a new facility there if certain requirements are met with the locals. One of them is that a doctor must live in the community.</p><p>As the villagers urgently try to persuade the doctor to stay, Dr. Christopher Lewis appears, setting off the amusing antics of the rest of the film.</p><h3><span id=Starbuck>Starbuck</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/starbuck_1.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>By the time they are 40 years old, some people need to mature and learn how to live responsibly. David Wozniak, not so. Up until everything started occurring to him at once, he has a reasonably carefree and relaxed life. When a lawyer unexpectedly shows up and reminds him of his past when he sold sperm to earn a fast profit, his girlfriend Valerie tells him that she is expecting his child. Over 100 people have filed a class action lawsuit to have his identity revealed since he is the biological father of more than 500 children.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ue015cff0b181289ace6ebf707b258703><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Movies Like The Big Lebowski With Badass Characters</span></a><p>It’s interesting to note that Patrick Huard portrays the lead role in both Starbuck and the prior film Bon Cop, Bad Cop.</p><h3><span id=Strange_Brew>Strange Brew</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/strange_brew_1983.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Rick Moranis’ debut film as an actor was Strange Brew, despite the fact that he is better recognized for his work in other movies like Spaceballs, Ghostbusters, or Honey, I Shrunk The Kids.

The stupid brothers discover a scheme to rule the globe using a mind-controlling substance slipped inside beer shipments as well as the mystery surrounding the murder of the late owner, John Elsinore. This PG-rated comedy is appropriate for viewers of all ages because it almost entirely centers around drinking beer.</p><h3><span id=Take_This_Waltz>Take This Waltz</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/take-this-waltz-5_rgb_wide-7e74f309e4fac207ad87265fe327e29aa622216b-s1100-c50.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The fantasy that many people have dabbled with once or twice in their lives is brought to life in the film Take This Waltz. On a flight back to Toronto, Margot meets Daniel, a charming and enquiring stranger, by happenstance. The two share a cab back to the same street and learn they are neighbors, which is an even larger coincidence.</p><p>People applaud the filmmaker, Sarah Polley, with bringing a new perspective to an otherwise worn-out cliché despite the fact that this kind of plot seems to have been used often. However, you might want to mentally prepare yourself because some of the more wholesome exchanges are interspersed with full-frontal nudity and other explicit material.</p><h3><span id=The_Delicate_Art_of_Parking>The Delicate Art of Parking</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/the-delicate-art-of-parking.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Have you ever let your meter run out of time and then sprinted back to your car in time to watch a police officer write you a ticket? Parking enforcer Grant Parker has received his fair share of criticism in The Delicate Art of Parking. Many people can harbor resentment for those who are merely carrying out their jobs.</p><p>As soon as you catch a sight of the cast’s chemistry, it’s simple to understand why this film was warmly appreciated. When it comes to parking, Grant won’t give any room for error, and the realistic responses of irate motorists are all too relatable. You may even argue that this film served as the catalyst for performers Fred Ewanick and Nancy Robertson’s successful sitcom Corner Gas, which helped them reach higher levels of comedy.</p><h3><span id=Trailer_Park_Boys>Trailer Park Boys</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/6IAadeGtwL32qQi9PHGmgqUymYGdGl.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=316 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The original beginning of the series, Trailer Park Boys, which debuted in 1999, should not be confused with the TV show of the same name or the movie Trailer Park Boys: The Movie. This film sets a high bar for the program as well as being frequently regarded as the greatest of all the films in the series. In order to leave behind a legacy, Julian records his criminal life in a trailer park after having a psychic prophesy his future and death over the phone.</p><p>Trailer Park Boys is the kind of slapstick humor that many people prefer to the excruciating secondhand embarrassment that may result from seeing other mockumentaries like <a href=#>The Office</a> or Parks and Recreation, despite being shot in <a href=#>black and white</a> and having a low budget overall.</p><h3><span id=Trailer_Park_Boys_Countdown_to_Liquor_Day>Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/GZ2UrRPG3w8CwckFXvS1YF3R9ch1zk.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=316 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>This film, which is really the third in the series but is set two years after the events of the TV episode Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys and not after the second film, shares many of the same characters and settings as the TV program Trailer Park Boys.</p><p>After being released from prison, the three main protagonists Ricky, Julian, and Bubbles all attempt to change their lives—some in sillier ways than others—in Trailer Park Boys: Countdown to Liquor Day. Although many people may not enjoy the filthy humor and dark humour in this film, those who can handle it will find it to be a nice chuckle. Although occasionally chaotic, the mockumentary format of The Office works effectively for this storyline.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uc2d685d5e61f33ada32bb474b3f3da1f><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>10 Hilarious Movies To Watch If You Love Booksmart</span></a><h3><span id=Trailer_Park_Boys_Don8217t_Legalize_It>Trailer Park Boys: Don’t Legalize It</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/TrailerParkBoys1.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Trailer Park Boys: Don’t Legalize It is an additional film in the series. It centers on the typical Sunnyvale trailer park dwellers and their absurd antics. In this film, crime is still king, but none of our heroes appear to have honed their trade yet. The conflict these criminals have between wanting to use marijuana for recreational purposes lawfully (due to an imminent bill in the Canadian government) and running a successful, if illegal, marijuana distribution operation may be the film’s most amusing plot point.</p><p>There is something to be said about following the bizarre lives of these miscreants, but by this point in the list, you probably already know if this brand of humor is for you or not.</p><h3><span id=Tucker_and_Dale_vs_Evil>Tucker and Dale vs Evil</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/l39oP4FWNq9IFCeW4MirefCwUnGKrB.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=316 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Tucker and Dale vs Evil, a humorous parody of other hillbilly <a href=#>horror films</a> like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, did well at the box office and has only grown in cult status over the years.

After the cops and a news crew come, these hillbillies have a terrible time navigating through life.</p><p>It’s little wonder that Tyler Labine and Alan Tudyk, who co-star in this amazing <a href=#>dark comedy</a>, have amassed so many admirers when you witness their on-screen connection.</p><h3><span id=Tusk>Tusk</span></h3><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/tusk-2014.jpg alt="best canadian comedy movies,canadian comedy movie 80s,canadian comedies tv shows,movie about a brewery,great white north movie,hey hoser,strange brew full movie,strange brew,canadian movies,80s canadian movies,best comedy movies,canadian comedy movies on netflix,canadian comedy movies 2020,french canadian comedy movies,famous canadian comedy movies,old canadian comedy movies,canadian beer comedy movies,canadian romantic comedy movies,good comedy movies on canadian netflix,top comedy movies on canadian netflix" width=600 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The film Tusk is a little peculiar, straddling the lines of both humor and horror. Wallace Bryton, a podcaster, has a small bit of celebrity, but it has gotten to his head, and he believes he is “that guy.” Wallace’s ambitious goals send him to Canada to conduct an interview, but when he meets Howard, things take a strange turn. Be warned, the film’s crazy premise is both humorous and unsettling in different ways.</p><p>The cast, though, might be the most peculiar aspect.

A small group of office workers wager one month’s pay to see who can stay inside the building the longest. This is only conceivable because of the downtown area’s expanding network of covered walkways that connect buildings.</p><p>Fortunately, the movie begins on day 24 of the wager, saving you from sitting through the dull beginning of the wager.

That was unquestionably the case when the picture won Best Adapted Screenplay at the 2nd Canadian Screen Awards after being hailed as “one of the hottest films” at the Toronto International Film Festival.
